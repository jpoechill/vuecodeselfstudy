            We're a friendly programming community made up of over 4,000 programmers in Berkeley and the 
            San Francisco Bay Area. All programming languages and levels of experience are welcome!<br>

              There are dozens of local meetup groups that teach people how to code. Here are some ways that we are different from most other groups:
              <ul id="main-list-items">
                <li>We are building a local community of friendly, creative, highly-motivated programmers in the Berkeley area.</li>
                <li>We're open to all programming languages, all levels of ability, and all types of programming (machine learning, scientific 	computing, hardware, systems programming, Web development, game programming, computer graphics, and more). If 	you like things like data science, lisps, logic, puzzles, esolangs, and mathematics you will probably find like-minded 	people here.</li>
                <li>We're working towards the establishment of a local programming space and educational center in Berkeley.</li>
                <li>If you are looking for a job, we would like to help you find a job -- and if you're just programming because you love 	programming, or you are interested in entrepreneurship instead of getting a job, this community is ideal for those things as well.</li>
              </ul>
              Some of the languages our members have been working with are: Python, JavaScript, Rust, Java, Scheme, Racket, Haskell, Clojure, Common Lisp, C, C++, C#, F#, Lua, Elixir, Erlang, Elm, Purescript, Ruby, Scala, PHP, Go, R, HTML/CSS, Octave, SQL and more. We're open to anything that is computer-related..

            </p>
            <p class="pages-row-body">
              You can attend our meetings as a self-directed, coding bootcamp alternative. Experienced programmers in the group can offer mentorship on a project-based approach to learning. <br><br>
              This community is self-directed -- if you would like assistance with forming a study plan, let us know in the forum, chatroom, and/or at the meetups.
