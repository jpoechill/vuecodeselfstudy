                Educational Center for Computer Programmers
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="pages-row-body">
              We're looking for assistance with opening a new kind of self-directed educational center for programmers in the Berkeley area. See the homepage and our event listings for a list of proposed activities.
              <br><br>
              Our programming school will provide an alternative to conventional coding bootcamps: a high-quality programming education without requiring large amounts of money, advance preparation, or a fixed time commitment. Our model is guided self-study with mentorship from the more experienced members.

                The Mission
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="pages-row-body">
              Some of the goals of this educational center are to: <br>
              <ul id="main-list-items">
                <li>Non-exclusive, without difficult barriers to entry. It's too difficult for many people to get into high-quality programming bootcamps — not necessarily because they don't have the potential to find success in the tech industry, but because the existing models are not ideal for everyone.</li>
                <li>Create a physical space where like-minded people can meet with their laptops to study together, bounce ideas off of each other, and collaborate on projects</li>
                <li>No time limit for attending. Stay as long as you want. The experienced members mentor the beginners.</li>
                <li>Bring together people who are interested in solving problems with Internet technology</li>
                <li>Function as a kind of alternative startup incubator for members' software projects</li>
                <li>Offer interesting classes to members and the public</li>
                <li>Discuss philosophy, especially technology philosophy</li>
                <li>Learn, study, and teach programming skills</li>
                <li>Extra outreach to autistic people, who often have high potential for success in the tech industry, but who face certain types of challenges.</li>
              </ul>

              We're looking for a space to rent within a few blocks of a BART station so that it's accessible to people without their own transportation.

                The Concept
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="pages-row-body">
              The purpose of the space is to do one specific thing very well: facilitate the learning of computer programming.
              <ol>
                <li>It will not exactly be a traditional "hackerspace", but will be centered around studying programming. There won't be the hardware and electronics of traditional hackerspaces/makerspaces. It will mainly focus on studying programming and related topics. (Note: small hardware projects that don't involve soldering, heavy machinery, and noise would be welcome. A goal is keep the space friendly for people who have difficulties with smells and noise.</li>
                <li>It will not be a "coworking space", because it's not designed around working but is focused on studying.</li>
                <li>The school will be a new kind of <strong>self-directed educational center for people who study computer programming</strong>.</li>

                Benefits for the Community
              </span>
            </p>
            <p class="pages-row-body">
              Here are some of the benefits for the community:
              <ul>
                <li>Provide a place for locals and visitors to learn how to program. Even experienced programmers need to study regularly to stay up to date with technology.</li>
                <li>Bring people together to collaborate on new programming projects and startups.</li>
                <li>Provide a supportive environment for startups in East Bay.</li>
                <li>Provide an inexpensive place where motivated people could learn to program in groups -- studying at the space could even function as a kind of non-traditional job training program for people looking to get into the tech scene.</li>
              </ul>
            </p>

            <p class="pages-row-body">
              If interested in the idea, please send us an email and/or leave a comment below. <br><br>
              We already have local meetup groups with over 4,000 local programmers. The next step is to find a dedicated space to meet. Check out our Code Self Study website and the main meetup group. <br><br>
