              There is free parking on the back streets near the library. If you head west on Russell Street for a couple of blocks, you should be able to find free all-day parking. (See the shaded area on the map image below.) There is also free parking to the north and east of the library. Keep an eye out for street sweeping signs, because there are some days when parking isn't allowed in certain areas.

              Parking in Downtown Berkeley can be difficult to find. It's often easier to park at the North Berkeley BART Station (free on Saturdays) and take the BART (or walk) to Downtown Berkeley.
