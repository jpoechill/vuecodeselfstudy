              Here is some feedback from our members:

                "I recently completed a coding boot camp in SF in an attempt to transition from food service to software development. Code Self Study has provided a needed environment to allow me continue my career development. It has allowed me to make personal connections to build my network in the coding community. Also, talking with others has helped guide me in more specific ways, for example in selecting languages to study, projects to try, etc. It has been of tremendous help to me."

                "CodeSelfStudy has been a big part of my life for the last 4-5 years. Through codeselfstudy, I have met people interested in programming. Together with them I participated in a hackathon where we placed number 4 out of ~100 teams. I made lifelong friends, even got a job I loved by attending a python meetup with some other Codeselfstudyers. But most important of all, the new thing about Codeselfstudy is Josh. I can ask him a code-related question whenever and wherever, and he will ALWAYS try to help me. I did not have such a support from the professors when I was in school, even though it was their job and Josh is just a volunteer who wants to help people."

                "Code Self Study is a lovely community guided by a service-minded leader. I was able to attend only occasionally, but it gave me company and friendly encouragement as I tried to learn new skills toward someday gaining financial independence. I am not yet employed, but I am excited to, as of this week, be a new member of a full-time community college associate's degree program in cybersecurity. The skills I learned in the last few years as a Code Self Study member gave me to courage to apply. 
                <br><br>
                I will add, as a nonwhite woman, that I experienced Code Self Study as a safe and welcoming place for women, people of color, and newbies. Thanks, Josh, for making it happen."

                "Code Self Study has literally changed the course of my life! When I first moved to the Bay Area I was still a lowly Windows user struggling to get my first python server running. One year later, I am getting paid to write python scripts. But the great part about Code Self Study is that it is not just about getting hired, it's about building a community and being better people through our community. The support and mentorship provided by the group is unmatched. The free-form, self-guided style of Code Self Study allows members to take their learning in which ever direction they choose, forcing us to actually think about what we are doing, rather than just performing route repetition. Even if no one is working on the same project as you, there is always a thoughtful ear willing to listen to your difficulties, share their knowledge, and suggest alternatives. If Code Self Study did not exist, I would certainly be a much different (perhaps worse) person."

                "This group not only helped me get started programming myself but as a credentialed teacher (authorized specifically to teach IT and Entertainment Arts) serving students in a job training program in the San Leandro Unified School District, I used the Berkeley group as my model in creating an entire digital design and development program at the school. My students have by now begun to get jobs and released apps. One student is working on an energy recapture system, another student prototyped a product now being sold to and use by hospitals in the South Bay, and the list goes on. Last week I spoke with the librarians in San Pablo at the new library about to open there just today began the arrangements to launch a group just like the Berkeley group which will serve the San Pablo community - its home being that new library. As a teacher licensed by the state to teach both adults and K-12, I am grateful for the support, encouragement, guidance, and example of the Berkeley group. This is the type of endeavor which not only is changing lives but when lives change, whole communities begin to change and are lifted up. That is my story of the group's impact on me as well as on the communities I serve."

                "Supportive environment for getting coding work done. Currently building a website for my self and my work. Find it hard to get the work done without an environment like code self-study."

                "Thanks to josh, i been introduced into a whole new world of opportunities. I am in the construction industry and am progressing steadily twowards the tech sector. His guidance, as well as all of the like minded people that attend the meet ups, has been not only instrumental, but greatly appreciated. If not for their help, i would be dreaming, instead of persuing a new career."
