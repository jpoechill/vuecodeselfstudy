              Code Self Study is completely free, but it's funded entirely out of my pocket. Since 2013, the project has only taken in a couple of hundred dollars in voluntary contributions out of thousands of dollars in expenses. If you would like to chip in a small amount to help offset the costs of organizing the community, please see below. Even small amounts (e.g., $5 to $25) to offset costs are greatly appreciated.
              <br><br>
              Expenses include meetup.com fees (hundreds of dollars in fees per year) and ongoing expenses of hosting the events.
              <br><br>
              Please note: there is no obligation at all to contribute to the group. It's completely free.
              <br><br>
              To contribute, go to the <a href="https://www.meetup.com/codeselfstudy/">main meetup page</a> and find the "chip in" button, or find me at a meetup. PayPal (josh@codeselfstudy.com) also works.
