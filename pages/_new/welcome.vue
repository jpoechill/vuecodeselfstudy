              Here is how to get started: <br>
              <ol>
                <li>Ask Josh or an organizer how to sign up on the website and get access to our chatroom.</li>
                <li>Introduce yourself to the people around you. The group is friendly and we are curious to find out about what you're working on.</li>
                <li>Write some computer programs. If you would like ideas on what to work on, ask Josh or one of the organizers.</li>
                <li>Be sure to join our <a href="https://community.codeselfstudy.com/">forum</a>, which is where you can join or create study groups and work on group projects with other members.</li>
                <li>The meetups are very informal -- you can arrive and leave at any time, so don't worry about being late or having to leave early.</li>

              Code Self Study is a place for programmers to meet, study, and collaborate in Berkeley.
              <br><br>
              Our meetups are informal and unstructured. You can work on a tutorial, book, course, or project, or find other people to collaborate with. (Ask at a meetup or in the forum.)
              <br><br>
              If you're new to programming and don't know where to start, ask Josh or post your question in the chatroom or forum.

              We have a chatroom where you can ask questions and share tips. To get access to the chatroom, <a target="_blank" href="https://community.codeselfstudy.com/">sign up for an account here</a>, and we'll add you to the chat room.
              <br><br>
              If you have questions, you can ask at the meetup, in the forum, or post the question in the chatroom. You can use the <code>#tech-questions-tips</code> or <code>#general</code> channels. (Don't worry too much about which channel to post in -- it's always okay to post in any channel.)
              <br><br>
              The format of the meetups is very informal: you can work on a tutorial, work on your project, talk to other programmers, find a partner for pair programming, or whatever you want. If you aren't sure about what to work on, check out some of our <a href="/wiki/Study_Guides">study guides</a> (works in progress).
              <br><br>
